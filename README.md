# Airlock Integrations Gateway Client SDKs

Multi-language client SDKs for the [Airlock Integrations Gateway](https://airlock.dev) — the enforcer-facing API for human-in-the-loop AI agent approval.

This repository is the **standalone home** for these SDKs. The same sources are also kept under `gateway_sdk/` in the main [Airlock](https://github.com/airlockapp/airlock) monorepo for product development; changes are periodically synced here.

> **Note:** These SDKs cover only the enforcer-safe endpoints exposed by the Integrations Gateway.
> Approver-facing operations (decision submission, inbox management, pairing resolution/completion) are not available through this surface.

## Developer Guide

For enforcer configuration, end-to-end encryption, workspace pairing, and integration patterns, see the [Airlock Enforcer Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).

## Gateway API Surface

All SDKs cover the **enforcer-side** endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method |
|----------|--------|
| `GET /echo` | Gateway discovery and health |
| `POST /v1/artifacts` | Submit an artifact for approval |
| `GET /v1/exchanges/{requestId}` | Get exchange status |
| `GET /v1/exchanges/{requestId}/wait` | Long-poll for decision |
| `POST /v1/exchanges/{requestId}/withdraw` | Withdraw a pending exchange |
| `POST /v1/pairing/initiate` | Start a new pairing session |
| `GET /v1/pairing/{nonce}/status` | Poll pairing status |
| `POST /v1/pairing/revoke` | Revoke a pairing |
| `POST /v1/pairing/pre-generate` | Pre-generate a pairing code (30-min TTL) |
| `POST /v1/pairing/claim` | Enforcer claims a pre-generated code |
| `POST /v1/presence/heartbeat` | Send a presence heartbeat |
| `GET /v1/policy/dnd/effective` | Fetch effective DND policies |

## Authentication

The SDKs support three user identity modes. PAT is the **recommended** method.

### Personal Access Token (PAT) — Recommended

The simplest and most secure option. Create a PAT from the Platform App or Mobile Approver, then set it on the client:

```python
client = AirlockGatewayClient(
    "https://igw.airlocks.io",
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
)
client.set_pat("airpat_...")
```

The SDK sends the PAT via the `X-PAT` header. PATs are prefixed with `airpat_` and can be created with a custom expiry date (max 1 year).

### Bearer Token (OAuth fallback)

Pass a JWT token issued by the Airlock Keycloak identity provider via Device Authorization Grant:

```python
client = AirlockGatewayClient("https://igw.airlocks.io", token="your-jwt-token")
```

### Enforcer App Credentials (ClientId / ClientSecret)

For third-party enforcer apps registered through the Developer Programme:

```python
client = AirlockGatewayClient(
    "https://igw.airlocks.io",
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
)
```

The SDK sends these as `X-Client-Id` and `X-Client-Secret` HTTP headers on every request.

### Dual Auth (Credentials + User Bearer Token)

Third-party enforcers that need user-scoped requests (e.g. consent-aware operations)
can authenticate with credentials **and** set a user's Bearer token after login:

```python
# 1. Create client with enforcer credentials
client = AirlockGatewayClient("https://igw.airlocks.io",
    client_id="your-client-id", client_secret="your-client-secret")

# 2. After user logs in (Device Auth Grant), set their token
client.set_bearer_token(access_token)
```

When both are present, the user's identity (PAT or Bearer token) takes precedence for user-scoped
operations, while credentials are still sent via `X-Client-Id` / `X-Client-Secret`.

> **Auth priority:** Gateway checks `X-PAT` first, then `Authorization: Bearer`, then app credentials.

> **Architecture Constraint:** Third-party enforcers must communicate **only** with the
> Integrations Gateway (`igw.airlocks.io`). The mobile app must communicate **only** with
> the Gateway (`gw.airlocks.io`). Direct backend access is not permitted for either.

## HARP Envelope Format

Artifact submission messages use the HARP Gateway Wire Envelope:

```json
{
  "msgId": "msg-...",
  "msgType": "artifact.submit",
  "requestId": "req-...",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "sender": { "enforcerId": "..." },
  "body": { ... }
}
```

See each SDK's README for language-specific usage examples.

## Pairing & End-to-End Encryption

During workspace pairing, the enforcer generates an **X25519 keypair** and sends the public key in the `PairingInitiateRequest`. When pairing completes, the gateway returns the approver's X25519 public key in the `responseJson` field of the `PairingStatusResponse`. The SDK then:

1. **ECDH key agreement** — computes the shared secret via X25519 scalar multiplication
2. **HKDF-SHA256** — derives a 32-byte AES-256 key using info string `HARP-E2E-AES256GCM`
3. **Saves** the derived key as `encryptionKey` in the enforcer configuration

This key is used for AES-256-GCM artifact encryption and decision decryption.

### Crypto Dependencies

| SDK | Library | X25519 | HKDF |
|-----|---------|--------|------|
| .NET | `NSec.Cryptography` | `KeyAgreementAlgorithm.X25519` | `HkdfSha256.DeriveBytes` |
| Go | `crypto/ecdh` (stdlib) | `ecdh.X25519()` | `golang.org/x/crypto/hkdf` |
| Python | `cryptography` | `X25519PrivateKey` | `HKDF(SHA256)` |
| Rust | `x25519_dalek` | `StaticSecret::diffie_hellman` | `hkdf::Hkdf<Sha256>` |
| TypeScript | `libsodium-wrappers-sumo` | `crypto_scalarmult` | `crypto.hkdfSync` |

> **Note:** All implementations follow the patterns in [harp-samples](https://github.com/AirlockHQ/harp-samples).

## Building & Packaging

A unified PowerShell script handles building, testing, packaging, and publishing all SDKs:

```powershell
# Build and package all SDKs (run from repository root)
.\scripts\package-sdks.ps1 -Sdk all -Version 0.1.0

# Build a single SDK
.\scripts\package-sdks.ps1 -Sdk dotnet -Version 0.1.0

# Build and push to registries
.\scripts\package-sdks.ps1 -Sdk all -Version 0.1.0 -Push `
    -NuGetApiKey "your-key" `
    -PyPiToken "your-token" `
    -NpmToken "your-token" `
    -CratesToken "your-token"
```

Output packages are placed in `dist/{language}/`.

| SDK | Registry | Command |
|-----|----------|---------|
| .NET | nuget.org | `dotnet nuget push` |
| Python | PyPI | `twine upload` |
| TypeScript | NPM | `npm publish` |
| Go | pkg.go.dev | `git tag` + `git push` |
| Rust | crates.io | `cargo publish` |

## Test Enforcer CLIs

Each SDK includes a fully interactive TUI test enforcer application that demonstrates the complete enforcer lifecycle — setup, sign-in, consent, pairing, heartbeat, artifact submission, decision polling, withdrawal, unpairing, and sign-out.

| Language | Path | Run Command |
|----------|------|-------------|
| .NET | [`src/dotnet/`](src/dotnet/) | `dotnet run --project Airlock.Gateway.Sdk.TestEnforcer` |
| TypeScript | [`src/typescript/test-enforcer/`](src/typescript/test-enforcer/) | `npm start` (build SDK first: `npm run build` in parent) |
| Go | [`src/go/`](src/go/) | `go run ./cmd/test-enforcer` |
| Python | [`src/python/`](src/python/) | `python test_enforcer.py` |
| Rust | [`src/rust/`](src/rust/) | `cargo run --bin test_enforcer` |

Configuration is persisted to `~/.airlock/test-enforcer-{language}.json` and restored automatically on subsequent runs.

All test enforcers default to **PAT as the recommended authentication** method, with OAuth Device Auth Grant as a fallback. The menu shows "Set PAT (recommended)" first.

See each SDK's README for detailed prerequisites and setup instructions.

## Roadmap
